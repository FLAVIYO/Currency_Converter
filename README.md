# Currency_Converter

The project is self explanatory , but more 
On this is that this was a very challenging 
Project for me as I was starting to learn 
Programming and this was the first ever project I
Conjectured on my own

The application takes my South Africa(R)
And converts to some of the major currencies like
US Dollars and British pounds
